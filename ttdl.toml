# A TTDL config. It can be in the current working directory - to support
#   ttdl settings on per project basis. Global user config must be in:
# * Linux: ~/.config/ttdl.toml
# * Windows: c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ttdl.toml
# * MacOS: /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/ttdl.toml
#
# available colors: black, red, dark_red, green, dark_green,
#   yellow, dark_yellow, blue, dark_blue, magenta, dark_magenta,
#   cyan, dark_cyan, grey, white
# If a value is not any of above colors it defaults to 'white'
[colors]
# overdue incomplete todos
overdue = "red"
# todos with overdue threshold date
theshold = "dark_red"
# todos with highest priority (A)
top = "red"
# important todos - with a priority equal to or higher than `ranges.important`
#important = "white"
# done todos
done = "grey"
# todos that are due today
today = "yellow"
# todos that are due in and less in `ranges.soon` days
#soon = "white"

[ranges]
# TTDL filter `soon` selects todos that are due in and less than in `soon` days
# 0 - disable `soon` feature
soon = 0
# todos that have priority equal or higher than `important` are displayed in
#   in `colors.important` font color.
# Priority is a chracter from 'a'(highest priority) through 'z'. Setting
#   `important` to any other value disables the feature
important = ""

[global]
# set global todo.txt filename. It works as environment variable TTDL_FILENAME,
#   but environment variable overrides config setting
# filename = "./"
# automatically set creation date to today if it is not set when adding a new todo
# creation_date_auto = true
